# code{}school : C++

## Source
The episodes are related to NGON's code{}school series that they have in a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcKpytGyWm9rrZ0CRy4Hal_6D_IVXZJnD). This repo will be my coding journey with C++ along with this playlist. Enjoy!

## Episode 00 - Setup
Setup lesson. We are getting c++ working on mac os x 10.13.6 where we compile and run our main.cpp code.
When the code is run it puts "Hello!" to the terminal.

## Episode 01 - the C++ Journey starts here
First episode of the new season! Head straight in to C++! Time to play around with the fundamental data types of C++: `bool`, `char`, `int` and `float`.

## Episode 02 - C++ Functions
Function in C++! We create a function which will reduce the health of something based on something else damage.
There's a homework too!

## Episode 03 - Again and Again with Loops
Loops! Loopy loop loops. Time to learn about loops, and loops, and loops, and loops ... 

## Episode 04 - Going to Class!
Let's go to Class! This time it's about time to learn about classes in C++, and what they are good for.

I'm experimenting a tiny bit here too with pointers (a bit early?) but that's just for fun.

## Episode 05 - The Structure of C++
Let's learn about structuring C++ code. It's time to use header and source files and we'll create a class which is in it's own file. Then we'll compile everything into one file. Awesome? A w e s o m e.

## Episode 06 - The Problem With Memory
More theory about how the memory is actually a thing to consider when coding in C++. Talking about `stack` and `heap`, and we're doing a bit of practice too. 

Oh, look, `pointers`.

## Episode 07 - Practicing Dynamic Memory
Dynamic Memory = Pointers? Cool! Let's gooo! We're learning about the `old way` of using pointers before moving on to `smart pointers`. It's good to know about the underlying problems which the `new way` solved. Awesome. Always awesome.

## Episode 08 - Smart Pointers and Containers
`shared_ptr`, `vector`, `string` are all good stuff. Smart pointers as `shared_ptr` are nice to use since we then don't need to think about deleting them after they are used, and we do not need to keep track where it is used since they will handle that themselves. 
Containers such as `vector` and `string` are just neat. N E A T.

## Episode 09 - Let's Put Theory Into Practice
Loads of show and tell, but where is the coding? Let's do the coding now and put all the theory we've got into a bit of practice. Now the fun begins.

## Episode 10
Last episode of this season. What do we do here? We will do some changes to the `old code` from season 01 (coding in [Processing](https://processing.org/)) to use a bit of the stuff we learned in the previous episodes.
